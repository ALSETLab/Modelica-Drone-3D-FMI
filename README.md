# Modelica Drone
## Scope & Goals
What started as a course project for drone control modeling, has become a larger project on multi-domain modeling for drones.
### Scope
We are hoping to continue to develop it as a Drone library, with the ability of modeling multiple domains (e.g. electrical power supply and management, thermal management, VR-based visualization, control modeling with different approaches - continious, discrete, synchronous - etc.).
### Goals
- To further enahance the models from different domains, with main modeling focus is on the electrical power and controls.
- To validate the model against a real prototype. We have procured an [FFT Gyro](https://eurekadynamics.com/fft-gyro/) platform to validate the models against a real prototype under controlled conditions.
- To establish sponsored research collaborations with funding bodies and private industry in the field. Please contact: luigi.vanfretti@gmail.com

We have received acceptance of an abstract discussing this model and we are preparing paper, which we would welcome you to cite as:

We will share an open access version of the paper when it is accepted.

### Development
Originally, the repository only included a drone model with 3D visualization (enabled by the Multi Body Library) and FMU export configuration developed using Modelica by Hao Chang and Luigi Vanfretti.

Today, the development is coordinated by Meaghan Podlaski, and we have received contributions from students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute involved in the Undergraduate Research Program and the course "Modeling and Simulation for Cyber-Physical Systems". Thank you to all that contribute to this fun and exciting effort!

# Contents

## A. Modelica Model

All sub-systems and simulation cases are contained within the ``./DroneSimulation/package.mo`` package. Each model is saved individually as its own file. The [Claytex VySeMA](http://https://www.claytex.com/products/dymola/model-libraries/vesyma/ "Claytex VySeMA") and [Modelon](http://https://www.modelon.com/products-services/modelon-library-suite-modelica-libraries/ "Modelon") Libraries are required to run models with non-ideal power systems using batteries and certain DC motor configurations. The full version of the [DLR Visualization](https://visualization.ltx.de/) library is required to run any of the models using VR in the ``DroneSimulation.Visualization.mo`` package.

How to simulate it?

1. Open ``./A_Modelica/package.mo``
2. The package structure is set up with the following sub-packages:
	- Examples
	- Blocks
	- Electrical
	- Mechanical
	- Sensors
	- Gyroscope
	- Visualization
	- Tests
3. Under the Examples/DroneWithIdealPowerSystem package, open the model ``TestSystem.mo`` and select it as ``Simulation model``. This has inputs that act as change in x, y, z coordinates of the drone and outputs x, y, z from the pseudo-GPS modeled within.
4. Go to simulation tab of your tool and change the simulation time to 10s then click simulate button.
5. This simulation should result with the z-coordinate approaching 5 meters, and the other coordinates (x,y) should be around zero. To verify, plot the variables ``.xgps``, ``.ygps`` and ``.zgps`` of the model by running the Modelica script ``drone_simulation_setup.mos``. You should obtain the result below.

6. Within Dymola, run the script ``drone_animation_setup.mos``, and then click on the ``Play`` button to see the animation. The red arrows indicate the force of the propellers.

## B. FMU
### Using the distributed FMU
- Within ``./B_FMI/`` an FMU generated by Dymola 2019 FD01 (64-bit) with both ME and CS (using Cvode) options are included.
Note that this model requires a Dymola license to execute in your local machine to run.

### Generating the FMU under Dymola 2019 FD01 (64-bit)
It is possible to generate an FMU from the Modelica model to provide inputs to x, y and z coordinate changes.
Under the 'Test' sub-package, the ``controlModuleTest_fmu_inputs`` model can be used. To generate the FMU using Dymola 2019 FD01 (64-bit) under Windows 10, follow the next steps:

1. Open ``./A_Modelica/DroneSimulation/package.mo``
2. Set as ``Simulation model`` the model under ``DroneSimulation.Examples.DroneWithIdealPowerSystem.DroneTests_FMU``

	![Alt text](/D_Pics/fmiexport/02_setmodel.png "Set model")

3. Go to the ``Simulation Setup`` menu ``Simulation>Setup...`` and provide the following configurations in the different tabs shown below:

	![Alt text](/D_Pics/fmiexport/03_general.png "General Settings")

	![Alt text](/D_Pics/fmiexport/03_compiler.png "Compiler Settings")

4. Under the ``Simulation`` mode, go to the menu ``Simulation>Translate>FMU``, and provide the following settings on the ``Export FMU`` window:

![Alt text](/D_Pics/fmiexport/04_fmuconfig.png "Export FMU Settings")


Alternatively, issue the following command under the ``Commands`` window of Dymola:

``translateModelFMU("DroneSimulation.Tests.controlModuleTest_fmu_inputs", false, "", "2", "all", false, 1);
 = "DroneSimulation_Tests_controlModuleTest_0fmu_0inputs"``

## C. Running the in Simulink using FMIKIT
- Install the [FMIKit](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMIKit-Simulink).

- Under the folder ``./C_SimulinkWithFMIKit`` a Simulink model ``./drone_model.slx`` set-up using FMIKit to reproduce the simulation scenario explained above.

- Note that you might need to reload the FMU using the one in the directory ``./B_FMI/`` as explained above.

- You should obtain the results shown below.

## D. Model Visualization and VR
To take advantage of this feature you need the [DLR Visualization](https://visualization.ltx.de/)
1. Open the models for visualization under ``DroneSimulation.Examples.Visualization.ModuleTest_SimVis`` and select it as ``Simulation model``.
2. Go to simulation tab of your tool and change the simulation time to 100s then click simulate button.
3. A window for the DLR SimVis application will open with the drone flying in a desert terrain. The drone can be controlled by the keyboard by default, but it can be reconfigured to control the drone with a joystick.
