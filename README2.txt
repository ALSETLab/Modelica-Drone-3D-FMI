A. Modelica Model

All sub-systems and simulation cases are contained within the 'DroneSimulation.mo' package.

How to simulate it?

1. Open ./DroneSimulation.mo
2. The package structure is set up with three sub-packages: (1) Tools (2) Module (3) Tests
3. Under the Tests package, open the model 'controlModuleTest_fmu_main.mo' and select it as 'Simulation model'.
   This has inputs that act as change in x, y, z coordinates of the drone and outputs x, y, z from the pseudo-GPS modeled within.
4. Go to simulation tab of your tool and change the simulation time to 10s then click simulate button.
5. This simulation should result with the "z" coordinate approaching 5 meters, and the other coordinates (x,y) should be around zero.
   To verify, plot the variables "xgps, ygps and zgps" of the model by running the Modelica script 'drone_simulation_setup.mos'
6. Within Dymola, run the script "drone_anymation_setup.mos", and then click on the "Play" button to see the animation.
   The red arrows indicate the force of the propellers.

B. FMU
It is possible to generate an FMU from the Modelica model to provide inputs to x, y and z coordinate changes.
Under the 'Test' sub-package, the 'controlModuleTest_fmu_inputs' model can be used.

Within ./B_FMI/ an FMU generated by Dymola 2019 FD01 (64-bit) with both ME and CS (using Cvode) options is included.
Note that this model requires a Modelica license to excecute in your local machine to run.

3. Simulink Model using FMKIT
Under the folder 'C_SimulinkWithFMIKit' a Simulink model set-up using FMIKit to reproduce the simulation scenario explained above.
Note that you might need to reload the FMU using the one in the directory ./B_FMI/ as explained above.
